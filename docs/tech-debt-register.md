# Tech-Debt Register

**Created:** 2026-06-12 (Epic 23 / US-23.1)

A single living catalog of (a) **dead/unused code** to remove and (b)
**hardcodes / anti-patterns** to improve. Populated during the Epic 23 cleanup
sweep (US-23.2–23.7) and consumed by a follow-up improvement epic (**Epic 24**).

**The split is deliberate.** Epic 23 *removes* dead code (deletions + tooling +
docs only). It only *records* the hardcodes/anti-patterns — those are fixed in
Epic 24, as deliberate reviewed changes, never mixed into deletion diffs.

## How to detect (the tooling — US-23.1)

```bash
# Python (from services/quant-engine/) — install once: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
ruff check app --select F401,F811,F841            # unused imports / redefs / locals (in-file)
vulture app vulture_allowlist.py --min-confidence 80   # unused functions/classes/attrs (whole-program)

# TypeScript (from apps/desktop/) — knip is a devDependency
npx knip                                          # unused files / exports / types / deps
npx tsc --noEmit                                  # in-file unused (once noUnusedLocals is enabled — see below)

# Both, via the canonical runner (US-23.8 will make this a zero-findings gate):
python scripts/detect_deadcode.py
```

**Allowlists are the integrity risk.** `vulture_allowlist.py` (and any future
knip ignore) must name *why* each entry is a dynamic-use false positive. An
unreasoned allowlist silently re-opens the door.

## Removal protocol (a symbol/file is "confirmed dead" only when ALL hold)

1. **No static reference** anywhere (grep + the area's detector agree).
2. **No dynamic / reflective use** — `getattr`, string-keyed dispatch, FastAPI
   route registration, pytest collection/fixtures, Pydantic
   `field_validator`/`model_post_init`, JSON `schema_version` round-trips,
   IndexedDB/localStorage **persistence or migration** sanitizers. (The
   admission-disposition plumbing is the cautionary example: it *looks* dead but
   sanitizes persisted state.)
3. **Not a public contract** still referenced by docs/types on the other side of
   a seam (reconcile in US-23.5 first if so).
4. The full `python scripts/run_all_tests.py` is green and `npx tsc --noEmit`
   clean **after** removal.

When in doubt → record as `dead-suspected` here, do **not** delete.

## Entry schema

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `area` | `backend/analytics-schemas`, `backend/services-routes`, `frontend`, `contracts`, `tests`, `scripts`, `cross` |
| `file:line` | location |
| `category` | `dead-suspected` · `hardcode` · `magic-number` · `anti-pattern` · `duplication` · `fragile-coupling` · `missing-abstraction` |
| `severity` | `low` · `med` · `high` |
| `effort` | `low` · `med` · `high` |
| `owner-story` | the Epic 23 story that acts on it (or `epic-24` for improvements) |
| `note` | one line |

## Findings

> Curated findings are added by US-23.2–23.7 as each area is swept. The raw
> detector baseline captured at US-23.1 is in the appendix below — later stories
> triage it into curated rows here (confirming dead vs. dynamic-use, assigning
> severity/effort), and append the hardcodes/anti-patterns they find.

| area | file:line | category | severity | effort | owner-story | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Appendix — detector baseline (captured US-23.1, 2026-06-12)

Raw detector output at epic start. **Unverified** — each item must pass the
removal protocol in its owning story before deletion (some are dynamic-use false
positives; some test-file items are intentional). Reproduce with the commands
above.

### Python — `ruff` (29 findings: 17×F401 unused-import, 12×F841 unused-local)

App (non-test) candidates → **US-23.2 / US-23.3**:
- `app/analytics/attribution.py` — unused imports `WINDOW_MIN_OBSERVATIONS`, `_series_to_returns` (from `app.analytics.risk`)
- `app/analytics/risk.py` — unused import `FactorRiskContribution`; unused locals `target`, `top_shared`, `alpha_annualized`, `specific_risk`, `collinearity_warnings`
- `app/schemas/reconciliation.py` — unused imports `LedgerRecord`, `ImportedPortfolioSnapshot`
- `app/services/dashboard_history_engine.py` — unused local `allow_exact_slice_benchmark_return_output`
- `app/importers/freedom24.py` — unused locals `isin`, `realized_pnl`, `account`

Test-file candidates → **US-23.6** (unused `pytest`/`Path`/`math` imports, unused locals in `test_analytics.py`, `test_attribution.py`, `test_drift_engine.py`, etc.).

### Python — `vulture` (min-confidence 80, allowlisted)

- `app/analytics/risk.py:10` — unused import `FactorRiskContribution` (also ruff F401) → **US-23.2**
- Test-file items (`test_exposure_engine.py` unreachable-after-return; unused vars in `test_market_data_fallback.py`, `test_yfinance_client.py`) → **US-23.6**
- (`app/schemas/imports.py` `__context` is allowlisted — Pydantic hook, not dead.)

### TypeScript — `knip` (7 unused files, 22 unused exports, 65 unused exported types) → **US-23.4** (types crossing the seam → coordinate **US-23.5**)

Unused files (highest-signal — confirm no dynamic import, then delete):
- `src/app/featureFlags.ts`, `src/app/portfolioState.ts`
- `src/features/portfolio/CurrentFactorSnapshotCard.tsx`, `DashboardPerformanceChart.tsx`, `SectorDonutCard.tsx`
- `src/features/portfolio/historyTruth.ts`, `investorEconomics.ts`

Plus 22 unused exported functions (incl. `portfolioDb` helpers, several
`portfolioAnalysisAdapter`/`portfolioSnapshot` builders, `portfolioFixtures`
factories) and 65 unused exported types in `types.ts` — many are contract
mirrors with no consumer (coordinate removal with **US-23.5**).

### Staged compiler flag

`tsconfig` `noUnusedLocals`/`noUnusedParameters` are **not yet enabled**:
turning them on surfaces ~20 in-file violations, several inside the knip
"unused files" above (which US-23.4 deletes) and in test/fixtures (US-23.6).
The flags are **staged for US-23.8** — enable them once US-23.4/23.6 clear the
blockers, so they go green as part of the standing dead-code gate.
