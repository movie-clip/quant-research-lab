# Financial Methodology

*Updated for Epic 8 (2026-05-25): ranking/construction/optimizer/backtest methodology removed.*

This document is the project-level reference for the financial and economic methodology implemented in the codebase.

For the canonical shipped-state boundary, use `docs/product/current-product-state.md`.

## Terminology

The project uses the term `factor` rather than `quant`.

Implemented factor families include:
- `market`
- `style`
- `sector`
- `macro`

Primary implementation:
- `services/quant-engine/app/analytics/risk.py`

## Truth Classes

The project distinguishes between different financial truth classes.

- `broker-truth historical diagnostics`
  - based on imported portfolio history or explicitly available historical context
- `snapshot current-state analytics`
  - based on current holdings only
- `synthetic snapshot-history diagnostics`
  - approximate historical diagnostics built from current holdings plus external market data
- `persisted imports`
  - saved import artifacts (content-addressed, immutable); broker truth is never mutated

Relevant implementation:
- `services/quant-engine/app/services/diagnostics_engine.py`

## Trust, Degradation, Withholding, and Unavailability

This is shipped baseline behavior across diagnostics and dashboard-history.

- `verified_*`
  - the contract can make the documented trust claim for that path
- `degraded_*`
  - the engine may still compute useful outputs, but trust must be downgraded explicitly and stronger claims must stay suppressed
- `withheld`
  - broader diagnostics or replay evidence exists, but investor-economics outputs stay intentionally suppressed until return-basis requirements are justified
- `unavailable`
  - the required source inputs or trustworthy path do not exist for the requested output

Consumer rule:
- do not treat `withheld` as generic missing data
- do not backfill withheld investor-economics families through nearby diagnostics or comparison views

Import admission rule:
- `ImportAdmissionSummaryV1` is read-only reconciliation evidence for imported broker snapshots; it does not mutate broker truth, trust levels, admission state, imported values, or workspace creation
- desktop-local `ImportAdmissionReviewDispositionV1` records reviewer rationale for non-pass checks only; it is not backend truth and has no backend persistence endpoint
- numeric admission evidence must be finite-only; non-finite imported numeric inputs become unavailable/degraded evidence rather than serialized `NaN` or `Infinity`

## Market Data Basis

The project uses historical price series, benchmark series, ETF holdings, and security metadata supplied through `MarketDataService`.

Primary implementation:
- `services/quant-engine/app/services/market_data.py`

Important financial rule:
- return-based analytics should use adjusted-close or stronger total-return-equivalent inputs whenever economically required

Current shipped hardening state:
- diagnostics degrades benchmark and factor source semantics to `live_market_data_unverified_return_basis` when adjusted-close trust is not proven
- diagnostics run-level confidence degrades when those paths remain unverified
- diagnostics and dashboard-history expose grouped `section_trust` so mixed trust does not collapse into one top-line label
- investor-economics withholding is policy-driven and explicit, not a generic market-data failure

Current adjusted-close verification rule:
- a history is marked `verified_adjusted_close` only when the required loaded rows explicitly support that claim under the current code path
- absence of that proof keeps the path degraded or withheld rather than silently upgrading trust

## Portfolio Return Methodology

### Cash-flow-neutral daily returns

For historical risk and factor diagnostics, the portfolio return series is built from daily portfolio states using a cash-flow-neutral formula.

Implemented formula:

```text
daily_return_t = ((total_portfolio_value_t - external_cash_flow_t) / total_portfolio_value_(t-1)) - 1
```

Implementation:
- `services/quant-engine/app/analytics/risk.py`
- `_portfolio_time_weighted_return_series(...)`

## Benchmark and Factor Return Methodology

Benchmark and factor returns are built from price series using simple daily returns.

Implemented formula:

```text
return_t = (price_t / price_(t-1)) - 1
```

Implementation:
- `services/quant-engine/app/analytics/risk.py`
- `_benchmark_return_series(...)`
- `_series_to_returns(...)`

Financial rule:
- these return paths must not overclaim investor-economics trust when adjusted-close or total-return-equivalent support is not proven for the specific contract path

## Wealth Index and Drawdown

### Wealth index

```text
wealth_0 = 100
wealth_t = wealth_(t-1) * (1 + daily_return_t)
```

### Drawdown

```text
drawdown_t = (wealth_t / running_peak_t) - 1
```

Implementation:
- `services/quant-engine/app/analytics/risk.py`
- `_build_wealth_index(...)`
- `_build_drawdown_from_return_index(...)`

## Volatility and Relative Risk

### Annualized realized volatility

```text
realized_vol = stdev(daily_returns) * sqrt(252)
```

### Downside volatility

```text
downside_t = min(return_t, 0)
downside_vol = stdev(downside_t) * sqrt(252)
```

### Tracking error

```text
active_return_t = portfolio_return_t - benchmark_return_t
tracking_error = stdev(active_return_t) * sqrt(252)
```

Implementation:
- `services/quant-engine/app/analytics/risk.py`

Contract rule:
- benchmark-relative outputs may be computed internally but still withheld or suppressed at the contract boundary when trust attestation is weaker than required

## Statistical Factor Model

The project implements a rolling ETF-proxy factor model.

Methodology string in code:

```text
Orthogonalized rolling ridge factor model using US ETF proxies for market, style, sector, and macro exposures; UCITS symbols are shown separately as EU execution examples.
```

Implementation:
- `services/quant-engine/app/analytics/risk.py`
- `factor_model_methodology()`

Core mechanics:
- factor proxy returns use simple daily returns on the selected history price series
- later factors are orthogonalized against earlier factors in configured order
- regression uses a very light ridge stabilization term
- rolling windows currently include `20d`, `60d`, and `252d`

Contract rule:
- factor-model and risk-contribution paths degrade explicitly when their return-basis trust is not proven

## Risk Contribution and Concentration

The project reports position and factor risk contribution metrics plus concentration diagnostics.

Implementation:
- `services/quant-engine/app/analytics/risk.py`

Contract rule:
- diagnostics-side concentration fields are history-derived risk concentration outputs
- current-state holdings concentration remains a separate snapshot truth class in exposure contracts

## Stress Scenarios

Stress scenario returns are estimated from current factor exposures.

Conceptually:

```text
estimated_scenario_return = sum(current_factor_loading_i * shock_i)
```

Implementation:
- `services/quant-engine/app/analytics/risk.py`
- `build_stress_scenarios(...)`

Contract rule:
- unavailable stress support must return `null`, not fabricated zeroes

## Current Known Financial Limitations

At the time of writing, the main finance-related limitations are:

- some return paths still remain intentionally degraded or withheld because total-return-equivalent trust is not yet proven broadly enough to unlock stronger claims everywhere
- factor interpretation still depends on factor ordering and proxy quality

## Maintenance Rule

When any of the following changes, update this file:
- financial formulas
- methodology strings
- factor definitions
- trust, degradation, withholding, or unavailability semantics
